        "Previously we wrote our simulation with classes for the atoms, the force-field and the MD simulation.Now we want to implement the velocity initialization. We will use the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to generate random velocities for the particles in our system. This ensures that our system starts in a state of thermal equilibrium, reflecting the physical reality of molecular motion.\n",
