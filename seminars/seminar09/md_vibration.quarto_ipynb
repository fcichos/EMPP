        "So far, we have already developed a basic molecular dynamics simulation for simple atoms and interactions by so-called van der Waals forces. Since we are already nearing the end of the course, we would at least like to add some more complexity to the simulation. In this seminar, we would like to make molecules by binding two atoms together. We will then simulate the vibration of these molecules by solving the equations of motion for the atoms.\n",

        "## Bond vibrations\n",
        "A bond vibration is modeled as a harmonic oscillator where two atoms are coupled by a spring force with spring constant $k$. The bond force on atom $i$ due to a bond with atom $j$ is then given by\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\vec{F}_{bond}^i = -k(\\vec{r}_{ij} - \\vec{r}_0)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $\\vec{r}_{ij}$ is the vector between atom $i$ and atom $j$ and $\\vec{r}_0$ is the equilibrium bond length vector. In reality bonds are not harmonic oscillators and deformations lead to a non-linear force curve. However, for small deviations from the equilibrium bond length, the harmonic approximation is quite good. The spring constant $k$ determines the strength of the bond and therefore the frequency $\\omega$ of the bond vibration\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $\\mu = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}$ is the reduced mass of the two bonded atoms with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Reduced units\n",
        "\n",
        "As we have defined reduced units for our simulation based on the LJ parameters, we need to express the bond parameters in these units.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Bond length\n",
        "\n",
        "The bond length $r_0$ is expressed in terms of the Lennard-Jones length scale $\\sigma$. For the bond between two hydrogen atoms, the equilibrium bond length is approximately $0.74\\sigma$.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ r_{\\text{bond}}^* = \\frac{r_{\\text{bond}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{H}}} = \\frac{0.74}{1.0} = 0.74 $$\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Spring constant\n",
        "\n",
        "The spring constant $k$ is expressed in reduced units based on the LJ energy scale $\\epsilon$ and length scale $\\sigma$. For a hydrogen molecule, the spring constant is approximately $440$ in reduced units.\n",
        "\n",
        "$$ k_{\\text{spring}}^* = \\frac{k \\sigma_{\\text{H}}^2}{\\epsilon_{\\text{H}}} $$\n",

        "## Equations of motion\n",
        "\n",
        "The equations of motion for the two atoms need to account for both the bond forces and the van der Waals forces. The total force on each atom is the sum of these contributions:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$m_1 \\ddot{\\vec{r}}_1 = \\vec{F}_{bond}^1 + \\vec{F}_{vdW}^1$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$m_2 \\ddot{\\vec{r}}_2 = \\vec{F}_{bond}^2 + \\vec{F}_{vdW}^2$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $\\vec{r}_1$ and $\\vec{r}_2$ are the positions of the two atoms, $\\vec{F}_{bond}$ are the bond forces described above, and $\\vec{F}_{vdW}$ are the van der Waals forces we implemented earlier. We can rewrite these equations as a system of first-order differential equations\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\dot{\\vec{v}}_1 = \\frac{\\vec{F}_{bond}^1 + \\vec{F}_{vdW}^1}{m_1}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\dot{\\vec{v}}_2 = \\frac{\\vec{F}_{bond}^2 + \\vec{F}_{vdW}^2}{m_2}$$\n",

        "\n",
        "$$\\dot{\\vec{r}}_2 = \\vec{v}_2$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The van der Waals forces act between atoms of different molecules while the bond forces act between atoms within the same molecule. Both types of forces are calculated at each timestep and combined to determine the total force on each atom.\n",

        "### The Bond class\n",
        "As we wrote the simulation quite modular, we can now easily add the bond forces to the simulation. To do so, we will first introduce a new class `Bond` that will store the bond parameters and the atoms involved in the bond.\n",
