        "In the last lecture, we have modeled electromagnetic waves not by solving the wave equation, but by taking the solutions of wave equations like a plane wave or a spherical wave. Today we will solve a wave equation, but not for electromagnetic waves, but for matter waves. We will solve the stationary Schrödinger equation with the implicit solution scheme, which we have already applied for the diffusion equation. With the help of that we will tackle the particle in a box, the harmonic oscillator and the periodic potential. All of these problems have also analytical solutions, thus we do not need the numerical solution in principle. But it will give us some practice on how to tackle such problems. As not all of you might be familiar with the physical description of quantum mechanics, we will give a short introduction into this field first. "

        "Quantum Mechanics assumes that all particles propagate as waves. They are described by a wavefunction $\\Psi(x,t)$. A quantum mechanical object thus posseses an amplitude and a phase which propagate in space and time. One could see the wavefunction in analogy to the electric field $\\vec{E}(x)$ of an electromagnetic wave. As the square of the electric field describes the propagation of energy of a wave, the square magnitude of the wavefunction, i.e. $|\\Psi(x,t)|^2$, describes the propagation of probability density of the quantum mechanical wave. The wavefunction itself is thus just the probability amplitude. \n",
