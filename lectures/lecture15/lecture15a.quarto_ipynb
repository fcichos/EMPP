        "In today's lecture, we will review and expand upon the numerical methods for solving differential equations that you've encountered in your mathematics courses. This is particularly important for physics students, as differential equations are the language in which many physical laws are written. Whether we're dealing with $F = ma$ in classical mechanics, Maxwell's equations in electromagnetism, or Schrödinger's equation in quantum mechanics, the ability to solve differential equations is essential.\n",
        "\n",
        "While analytical solutions are elegant and preferred when available, many real-world physical problems require numerical approaches. We will focus on numerical methods that you can implement yourself, starting with the simplest approaches and building up to more sophisticated techniques.\n",

        "The Taylor expansion is the basis for many numerical methods for solving differential equations.

        "\n",
        "While the above code is what we did fo the simples numerical integration, you can now modify the code inside the `euler` function to implement any  improved Euler method. An improved Euler method (also called Heun's method) is based on averaging the slopes at two points. To understand why this works better than the simple Euler method, let's look at the Taylor expansion again around $t_0$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "f(t_0 + \\Delta t) \\approx f(t_0) + \\Delta t f'(t_0)\n",

        "\n",
        "We can improve this simple formula by taking the avarage of the derivative at $t_0$ and the derivative at the predicted point $t_0 + \\Delta t$:\n",

        "$$\n",
        "f(t_0 + \\Delta t) \\approx f(t_0) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} (f'(t_0) + f'(t_0 + \\Delta t))\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This effectively now introduces the curvature of the function at $t_0$ into the approximation. We can see this by expanding the improved Euler method in a Taylor series. The first derivative at $t_0$ is $f'(t_0)$, and the derivative at the predicted point $f'(t_0 + \\Delta t)$ can be expanded as $f'(t_0) + \\Delta t f''(t_0)$. When we average these two derivatives and multiply by $\\Delta t$, we get $\\Delta t f'(t_0) + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2} f''(t_0)$, which matches the first two terms in the Taylor expansion. This is why the improved Euler method has an error of order $O(\\Delta t^2)$ compared to $O(\\Delta t)$ for the simple Euler method.\n",

The prey population grows until it reaches a maximum, at which point the predator population increases due to the abundance of prey. The predators then reduce the prey population, leading to a decrease in the predator population. This cycle continues indefinitely, demonstrating the complex dynamics of ecological systems.\n",

        "The population values below 1 mean that we have less than one individual in our population, which is not physically meaningful in a biological context. Our model treats populations as continuous variables, but real populations consist of discrete individuals. When the numerical solution shows population values less than 1, this indicates that the model has entered a regime where its continuous approximation breaks down and we should instead use a discrete model that can properly handle individual organisms. In practice, once a population drops below 1, we should consider it extinct.\n",
        "\n",
        "This limitation of continuous models is particularly important in conservation biology and population management, where understanding the threshold for population viability is crucial. When modeling endangered species or small populations, we often need to switch to discrete population models or include additional factors like demographic stochasticity that become important at low population numbers."
