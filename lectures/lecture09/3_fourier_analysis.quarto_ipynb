        "Fourier analysis, or the description of functions as a series of sine and cosine functions, serves as a powerful tool in both numerical data analysis and the solution of differential equations. In experimental physics, Fourier transforms find widespread applications. For instance, optical tweezers utilize frequency spectra to characterize positional fluctuations, while Lock-In detection employs Fourier analysis for specific frequency signals. Additionally, many optical phenomena can be understood through the lens of Fourier transforms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Fourier analysis extends far beyond these examples, finding applications across numerous fields of physics and engineering. In this lecture, we will examine Fourier Series and Fourier transforms from a mathematical perspective. We will apply these concepts to analyze the frequency spectrum of oscillations in coupled pendula, and later revisit them when simulating the motion of a Gaussian wavepacket in quantum mechanics.\n",
