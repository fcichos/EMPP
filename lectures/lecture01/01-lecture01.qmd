## Why Jupyter? 🚀

As physicists, we need to:

- **Calculate** results from equations
- **Visualize** data and theoretical predictions
- **Document** our work with equations and explanations
- **Share** reproducible results with colleagues

Jupyter Notebooks let us do all of this in **one place**!

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
### What You'll Create Today
By the end of Week 1, you'll generate plots like this:

```{python}
#| echo: false
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

t = np.linspace(0, 2, 100)
x = 5 * t
y = 10 * t - 5 * t**2

plt.figure(figsize=(7, 4))
plt.plot(x, y, 'b-', linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel('Horizontal Distance (m)', fontsize=11)
plt.ylabel('Height (m)', fontsize=11)
plt.title('Projectile Motion', fontsize=12)
plt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

**All from physics equations you already know!**

## What is a Jupyter Notebook?

A Jupyter Notebook is a **web-based interactive document** that combines:

- **Code** (Python) that you can run
- **Results** (numbers, plots, animations)
- **Documentation** (text, equations in LaTeX)

Think of it as a **digital lab notebook** for computational physics.

::: {.callout-tip}
### Key Advantage
Unlike traditional programming where you write everything first and then run it, Jupyter lets you **experiment interactively** - run small pieces of code, see results immediately, and build up your solution step by step.
:::

---

## Opening Jupyter Lab

### Option 1: Anaconda Navigator (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Open **Anaconda Navigator**
2. Click **Launch** under **JupyterLab**
3. Your browser opens automatically

### Option 2: Command Line
Open terminal and type:
```bash
jupyter lab
```

::: {.callout-important}
### Troubleshooting
If Jupyter doesn't start, check:
- Anaconda is installed
- You're connected to the internet (first time only)
- Try restarting Anaconda Navigator
:::

---

## JupyterLab Interface

When JupyterLab opens, you'll see:

- **Left sidebar**: File browser (like Windows Explorer/Finder)
- **Main area**: Where notebooks open
- **Launcher tab**: Click "Python 3" under Notebook to create a new notebook

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Try It Yourself (Embedded Demo)
Here's a live JupyterLab environment you can experiment with:

```{=html}
<button onclick="document.getElementById('myIframe').requestFullscreen()">Open Fullscreen</button>
<iframe id="myIframe" src="https://jupyterlite.github.io/demo/" width="100%" height="500px" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```
:::

---

## Creating Your First Notebook

1. Click **Python 3** tile under "Notebook" in the Launcher
2. A new tab opens with an empty notebook
3. Save it: **File → Save Notebook As...** → `physics_week1.ipynb`

::: {.callout-tip}
### File Extension
Jupyter notebooks end in `.ipynb` (IPython Notebook)
:::

---

## Two Types of Cells

Jupyter notebooks consist of **cells** - individual blocks that contain either code or text.

### Code Cells (Default)
- Write Python code here
- Run to see results
- Identified by `[ ]:` on the left

### Markdown Cells
- Write notes, explanations, equations
- Use for documentation
- Change a cell to Markdown: Click cell, then press **`M`** key

---

## Your First Calculation 🎯

Let's calculate gravitational potential energy!

### Physics
$$E_{\text{pot}} = mgh$$

### Code
Type this in your first cell:

```python
# Gravitational potential energy
m = 2.0    # mass in kg
g = 9.81   # gravity in m/s²
h = 10.0   # height in m

E_pot = m * g * h

print(f"Potential energy: {E_pot} J")
```

### Run It!
- **Click the ▶ button** (top of cell), OR
- Press **`Shift + Enter`** (run and move to next cell), OR
- Press **`Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`** (run and stay)

You should see: `Potential energy: 196.2 J`

::: {.callout-tip}
### Pro Tip
**`Shift + Enter`** is the most common way to run cells - you'll use this constantly!
:::

---

## Essential Keyboard Shortcuts

You'll save tons of time with these shortcuts:

### Running Cells
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Shift + Enter` | Run cell and move to next |
| `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` | Run cell and stay |

### Cell Operations (press `Esc` first to enter command mode)
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `B` | Insert cell **below** |
| `A` | Insert cell **above** |
| `D D` | **Delete** cell (press D twice) |
| `M` | Change to **Markdown** cell |
| `Y` | Change to **Code** cell |
| `Z` | **Undo** delete |

### Editing
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Enter` | Enter edit mode |
| `Esc` | Exit edit mode (command mode) |

::: {.callout-note}
### Two Modes
- **Edit mode** (green border): Type in cell
- **Command mode** (blue border): Use keyboard shortcuts

Press `Esc` to switch to command mode, `Enter` to switch to edit mode.

## Try It: Multi-Step Calculation

Let's calculate the time for a ball to fall from height h.

**Physics:** $h = \frac{1}{2}gt^2$ → $t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$

**Your Task:**

1. Create a new cell below (press `B`)
2. Type this code:

```python
import numpy as np  # We need square root

h = 10.0   # height in m
g = 9.81   # gravity in m/s²

t = np.sqrt(2 * h / g)

print(f"Fall time: {t:.2f} seconds")
```

3. Run it! (`Shift + Enter`)

---

## Adding Documentation with Markdown

Good physics notebooks explain what you're doing!

### Create a Markdown Cell

1. Insert a new cell above your code (press `Esc`, then `A`)
2. Change it to Markdown (press `M`)
3. Type:

```markdown
## Free Fall Calculation

We calculate the time for an object to fall from height $h = 10$ m.

The equation is:
$$t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$$

where $g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$ is gravitational acceleration.
```

4. Run the cell (`Shift + Enter`) to render it

::: {.callout-tip}
### LaTeX Equations
- Inline equation: `$E = mc^2$` → $E = mc^2$
- Display equation: `$$E = mc^2$$` → $$E = mc^2$$
:::

## Saving Your Work

Jupyter **auto-saves** every few minutes, but you should also:

- **Manual save**: `Ctrl/Cmd + S` or File → Save Notebook
- **Download**: File → Save and Export Notebook As → HTML/PDF

::: {.callout-warning}
### Important!
Saving the notebook saves your **code and markdown**, but also the **output**. If you want a clean notebook, do: Kernel → Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs before saving.
:::

## What's Next? 📊

Now that you know the basics:

1. **Next lesson**: [Plotting Your First Graph](../lecture04/04-plotting.qmd)
   - You'll create beautiful physics visualizations

2. **Then**: [Variables & Numbers](02-lecture01.qmd)
   - Understand what you just used in detail

---

## Quick Reference Card

### Most Important Commands
```
Shift + Enter  → Run cell
Esc + B        → New cell below
Esc + M        → Change to Markdown
Esc + D D      → Delete cell
Ctrl/Cmd + S   → Save
```

### Getting Help
- **Function help**: Type `?function_name` in a cell and run
- **Documentation**: Press `Shift + Tab` while cursor is on a function name

## Advanced Topics (Optional)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### What is a Kernel?

The **kernel** is the computational engine that runs your code. Think of it as Python running in the background.

**Kernel indicator** (top-right):
- ⚪ **Idle**: Ready to run code
- ⚫ **Busy**: Currently executing

**Kernel menu operations**:
- **Restart Kernel**: Clears all variables, starts fresh
- **Interrupt Kernel**: Stops long-running code

You'll need to restart if:
- Variables get messy
- Code is stuck in an infinite loop (interrupt first, then restart)
- You want a clean slate
